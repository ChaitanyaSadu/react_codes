<!-- Intro -->
React developed and maintained by facebook.
Current version- 18.2
React->Javascript Library

<!-- Breaking Changes in React- -->
=>before 16.8, approaches are different for building components.
=>after 16.8, multiple approaches to build react components.

<!-- Client-side Rendering -->
DOM tree formed in browser.
<!-- server-side rendering -->
DOM tree formed in server and given to browser.

<!-- CRA -->
how to create a react application from scratch.

<!-- CRA-command -->
npx create-react-app application_name(lowercase)

-> it automatically downloads some dependencies and folder structure for the app.

<!-- difference bwn npx and npm -->

<!-- node package manager --> 
contains packages and dependencies
command--->npm install (package_name) || npm i package_name
 or (dependencies name)

 <!-- for specific versions: -->
 npm i name@version


<!-- other approach to create reactapp -->
by linking cdn links to script tag.

<!-- cons-> -->
when application is loaded,the entire package library data is going to download into the browser.

but if we install npm i package, it is going to take already running package somewhere and gives reference to us,not download. 



<!-- folder created contains subfolders -->
any dependencies installed commes into node-modules folder.
package.json-dependencies are present,when cra are created

node modules are required when apllication to be run in local,but when we want to run application in server node_modules are not needed.


<!-- <scripts> -->
start:  npm start == to start react app
build:  after application is created,when it is to be given to user.
        application need to be build using npm run build command and deploy it in server/production.
        it creates new build folder.
test:   to check components running perfectly,we write test cases.
        npm run test-->tests the test cases.
eject:  ejects all configured things before
        modifies the dependencies present compared to before.
        once ejected ,cra doesnot come back into normal mode,again configured scripts cannot come back.
        cra will be in ejected mode only.


<!-- DEFAULT PORT:  -->
        react inbuilt creates port that can be changed.
