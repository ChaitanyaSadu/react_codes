<!-- This first method is not a popular way to set up React 
    and is not how we'll be doing the rest of our tutorial, 
    but it will be familiar and easy to understand if you've ever used a library like jQuery,
    and it's the least scary way to get started if you're not familiar with Webpack, Babel, and Node.js. -->
